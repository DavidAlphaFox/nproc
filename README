                                   Nproc

                   Process pool implementation for OCaml

A master process creates a pool of N processes. Tasks can be submitted
asynchronously as a function and its argument (f, x). As soon as one of
the processes is available, it computes (f x) and returns the result.

This library allows to take advantage of multicore architectures
by message-passing and without blocking. Its implementation relies
on fork, pipes, Marshal and Lwt (http://ocsigen.org/lwt/manual/).
